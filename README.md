# Timeline Tool

This is a small React application designed to test if you know the timeline of historic events for your upcoming exam. 

Current dataset: events2.json

If you want your data set uploaded to the application, feel free to reach out. 

Please format your data set as follows:
'[
  {"name" : "Event 1", "date" : "2024"},
  ...
]

ChatGPT is usually pretty helpful if you pass your data set and that example snippit in the prompt.
